# Coffee Quality Analysis | Power BI Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project analyses coffee quality data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) to understand what factors influence coffee quality as measured by Total Cup Points.
The analysis is presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard, focusing on sensory attributes, defects, and other contributing factors.
### The goal is to identify:
What improves coffee quality  
What degrades coffee quality  
Which factors have little or no impact  
## Objectives
Analyse factors that increase Total Cup Points  
Identify factors that reduce coffee quality  
Understand which attributes do not significantly affect quality  
Provide insights that can help growers, processors, and roasters improve coffee quality  
## Key Metrics & Attributes Analysed
### Quality Measurement
Total Cup Points (sum of sensory scores)  
### Sensory Attributes
Aroma  
Acidity  
Aftertaste  
Flavour  
Body  
Balance  
Sweetness  
Clean Cup  
Uniformity  
Overall  
### Other Influencing Factors
Category 1 & Category 2 Defects  
Quakers  
Moisture Percentage  
Coffee Age  
Processing Method  
Variety  
Altitude  
Country & Region  
## Key Insights
-All sensory attributes contribute equally to Total Cup Points

-Certain factors like defects and quakers have a strong negative impact

-Moisture percentage and Category 1 defects show similar patterns in both high and low quality coffees, indicating they are not strong determining factors

-Specific countries, regions, and processing methods consistently perform better with fewer defects

-Identifying common categories with low defects and quakers helps define ideal conditions for high-quality coffee

## Dashboard Highlights
Comparison of top vs lowest quality categories

Defects and quakers distribution across coffee samples

Best-performing categories with minimal defects

Visual insights to support data-driven decisions in coffee production
